# Vector Algebra

## Definition
A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector. Notice that a directed line segment is a vector, denoted as |**AB**| or simply as |**a**|, and read as ‘vector **AB**’ or ‘vector **a**’. The point A from where the vector starts is called it's initial point, and the point B where it ends is called it's terminal point. The distance between initial and terminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as |**AB**|, or |**a**|, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector.
Note Since the length is never negative, the notation |a| < 0 has no meaning.

## Position Vector
Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to the origin O(0, 0, 0). Then, the vector having O and P as its initial and terminal points, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect to O. Using distance formula, the magnitude of |**OP**| is given by distance of O from P.

## Direction Cosines
The cosine values of angles made by a vector with X, Y, Z axis are called direction cosines and are denoted by l,m,n respectively.

## Types of Vectors
#### Zero vector OR Null Vector
Magnitude=0
initial point = terminal point
it can be considered as having no direction or all direction
#### Unit Vector
magnitude=1 unit
#### Coinitial Vectors
Vectors having the same initial point
#### Collinear Vectors
Vectors parallel to each other irrespective of their magnitude or direction
#### Equal Vectors
Vectors having the same magnitude and direction irrespective of their initial points
#### Negative of a Vector
Vector whose magnitude is same as that of a given vector but direction is opposite to that of it.
#### Free Vectors
 The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its parallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are called free vectors.
## Addition of Vectors
#### Triangle Law Of Vector Addition
**AC**=**AB**+**BC**

#### Parallelogram Law Of Vector Addition
If we have two vectors represented by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram in magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their sum is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram through their common point. This is known as the parallelogram law of vector addition.

#### Properties Of Vector Addition
**a**+**b**=**b**+**a** (commutative property)
**a**+(**b**+**c**)=(**a**+**b**)+**a** (associative property)
Because of the associative property we can write the sum of 3 vectors without brackets.
i.e. **a**+**b**+**c**
## Multiplication of Vector by a scalar
The result of multiplying a vector **a** by a scalar q is given by q**a**.
The direction of the resulting vector is either same or opposite of the given vector depending on whether q is positive or negative.
If q = -1 then resulting vector **-a** is the additive inverse of **a**
If q = 1/|a| then resulting vector is a unit vector.
If q = 0 then resulting vector is zero or null vector.

## Components of a vector
Vector in component form can be written as **xi+yj+zk** where **i,j,k** are unit vectors along the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis respectively.
Consider 2 vectors a and b
**a=a1i+a2j+a3k**
**b=b1i+b2j+b3k**
#### Sum of 2 vectors
**a+b=(a1+b1)i+(a2+b2)j+(a3+b3)k**
#### Difference of 2 vectors
**a-b=(a1-b1)i+(a2-b2)j+(a3-b3)k**
#### Equality of 2 vectors
a=b iff a1=b1,a2=b2,a3=b3
#### Multiplication of a vector by a scalar
**qa=(qa1)i+(qa2)j+(qa3)k**
Let **a** and **b** be any two vectors, and k and m be any 2 scalars. Then
k**a** + m**a** = (k+m)**a**
k(m**a**)=(km)**a**
k(**a**+**b**) = k**a**+k**b**
#### Direction Ratios
**a=a1i+a2j+a3k**
a1, a2, a3 are the direction ratios
#### Direction Cosines
if it is given that l, m, n are direction cosines of a vector, then **li+mj+nk** = **(cosα)i +(cosβ)j+(cosγ)k** is the unit vector in the direction of that vector, where α, β and γ are the angles which the vector makes with x, y and z axes respectively.
#### Collinear Vectors
Two vectors
**a=a1i+a2j+a3k**
**b=b1i+b2j+b3k**
are collinear iff
a1/b1 = a2/b2 = a3/b3 = k
#### Vector joining 2 points
**A=a1i+a2j+a3k**
**B=b1i+b2j+b3k**
**AB=(b1-a1)i+(b2-a2)j+(b3-a3)k**
Magnitude = squareRoot((b1-a1)x(b1-a1) + (b2-a2)x(b2-a2) + (b3-a3)x(b3-a3))
## Section Formula
Let **OP** = **a** and **OQ** = **b**
Point **R** divided **PQ** internally in the ration m:n
**OR** = **r** = (mxb+nxa)/(m+n)
Point **R** divided **PQ** externally in the ration m:n
**OR** = **r** = (mxb-nxa)/(m-n)
## Product of 2 vectors
There are 2 types scalar(or dot) product and vector(or cross) product
#### Scalar(or dot) product
The scalar product of two nonzero vectors **a** and **b** denoted by **a.b** and is defined as
|a||b|cos(θ) where θ is the angle between **a** and **b** in anticlockwise direction
**0<=θ<=π**
If either **a** = 0 OR **b** = 0 then θ is not defined and in this case we define **a.b** = 0
1. **a**.**b** is a real number
2. If **a** and **b** are not zero then **a**.**b**=0 iff **a** and **b** are perpendicular
3. If θ = 0, then a.b=|a||b| and a.a = |a|x|a| as θ in this case is zero
4. If θ = π, then a.b=-|a||b| 
5. For mutually perpendicular unit vectors along x,y and z axes i,j and k, we have i.i=1 , j.j=1, k.k=1 and i.j = j.k = k.i = 0
6. Angle between 2 nonzero vectors a and b is given by cos(θ) = a.b/(|a||b|) OR θ = cosInverse(a.b/(|a||b|))
7. The scalar product is commutative i.e. a.b=b.a
#### Two important properties of scalar product
1. Distributivity of scalar product over addition. Let **a,b,c** be any 3 vectors **a.(b+c)**=**a.b+a.c**
3. Distributivity of scalar product over multiplication. Let **a,b** be any 2 vectors and q be any scalar **(qa).b=q(a.b)=a.(qb)**
#### Dot Product Of Vectors In Component Form
**A=a1i+a2j+a3k**
**B=b1i+b2j+b3k**
**A.B = (a1i+a2j+a3k).(b1i+b2j+b3k) = (a1b1)i + (a2b2)j + (a3b3)k**

## Projection of a Vector On A Line
1. If **p** is the unit vector along a line l, then the projection of a vector **a** on the line l is given by a **a.p**.
2. Projection of a vector **a** on other vector **b**, is given by **(a.b)/|b|** OR **(1/|b|)(a.b)**
3. If **θ = 0** then projection of AB will be **AB**. If **θ = π** then projection of **AB** will be **-AB**. 
4. If **θ = π/2** OR **θ = 3π/2** then projection of **AB** will be zero

## Direction Cosines
 If α, β and γ are the direction angles of vector **a1i + a2j + a3k**, then its direction cosines may be given as cosα = a1/|a1|, cosβ = a2/|a2|, cosγ = a3/|a3|
## CauchySchwartz inequality
|a.b|<=|a||b|
## Triangle Inequality
|a+b|<=|a|+|b|

## Vector(OR Cross) Product
The vector product of two nonzero vectors **→a** and **→b** , is denoted by **→a** x **→b** and defined as **→a x →b = |a||b|sinθ nˆ**,
where, θ is the angle between , 0 ≤ θ ≤ π and nˆ is a unit vector perpendicular to both →a and →b,such that form a right handed system i.e., the right handed system rotated from →a to →b moves in the direction of nˆ .
If either →a=0 or →b=0, then θ is not defined and in this case, we define →a x b→ = 0.

#### Observations
1. →a x b→  is a vector
2. Let →a and →b be 2 nonzero vectors then →a x →b  = 0  iff →a and →b  are  parallel or collinear to each other. In particular →a x →a = →0 And →a x (-→a) = →0  . In  the  first case θ = 0 and in the second case θ = π
3. If θ = π/2 then |→a x →b|  = |→a||→b|
4. For the unit vectors perpendicular to the axes we have →i x →j = →k, →jx →k= →i,  →k x →i
= →j AND →i x →i = 0  →j x →j = 0   and  →k x →k  = 0 
5. In terms of vector product angle between →a and →b is given by sinθ = (→a x →b)/|→a||→b|
6. Vector product is non commutative as **→a x →b = - (→b x →a)**
7. →j x →i = - →k , →i x →k = - →j  and  →k x →j = -→i
8. If →a and →b represent the adjacent sides of a triangle then its area is given as |→a x →b|/2
9. If →a and →b represent the adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then its area is given
by |→a x →b|

#### Distributivity of vector product over addition: 
If →a , →b , →c are any three vectors and λ be a scalar, then:
1. (→a x →b) x →c =  →a x (→b x →c)
2. λ x(→a x →b) = (λ→a) x →b  =  →a x (λ→b)
